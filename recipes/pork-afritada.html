    <p>Pork, liver, and potatoes are cooked in a tomato base to make this Filipino stew elegant enough for special occasions.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ¼ pounds boneless pork, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>2 pounds pork liver</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 potatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 large tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the pork in a large pot; pour enough water into the pot to cover the pork. Stir the soy sauce and lemon juice into the water. Bring the mixture to a boil for 5 minutes. Remove the meat and set aside. Discard the liquid.</li>
        <li>Refill the pot with fresh water; add the pork liver and bring to a boil for about 5 minutes. Remove the liver and allow to cool; cut into bite sized pieces. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; fry the potatoes in the hot oil until golden brown and cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove the potatoes to a plate lined with paper towels. Add 2 more tablespoons olive oil to the skillet and allow to get hot. Cook and stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the pork and pork liver to the skillet; cover and cook for 5 minutes. Stir the tomatoes into the mixture; cook together, stirring occasionally, another 5 minutes. Return the potatoes to the skillet with the green bell pepper. Season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir another 5 minutes.</li>
